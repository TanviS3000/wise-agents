# Since we are using secrets in our tests, we need to take some extra precautions.
# on pull_request: jobs do not have access to secrets.defaults:
# This job will only run if a pull request is opened by a member of the team. If opened by an external contributor
# approval from a team member is required.
# Once this job completes, the build-and-test-workflow-run.yml workflow will run.
#
# See https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/the-many-shas-of-a-github-pull-request/ for the SHA's which are important:
# * github.sha - the SHA used by the checkout action. It represents the behind-the-schenes
#  merge of the PR into the base branch.
# â€¢ github.event.pull_request.head.sha - the commit SHA identifying the PR. We need this to update the status check
# for the PR. See https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/creating-github-checks/ for more information.
