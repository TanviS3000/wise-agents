  * Engage with other community members.
  * Please introduce yourself if you are posting the first time
  * Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we
  build together ðŸ’ª.

## ðŸ‘‹ Zulip Chat!
  Weâ€™re using Zulip Chat as another place to connect with other members of our community. 
  This is a good place to connect directly and quickly with other community members.
  You can ask question and start discussions there, just remember it's not a support chat, but just a community chat.
  For more involved discussions or to help keep track things, other community members might ask you to start a GitHub Discussion.
  Chat gives the community a great power...but you know from a great power comes great responsibility, so be open-minded and remember this is a community we are building together.
